Overview
**********************************
AI vehicles that search out meteors and bring them back to base
Towers that shoot and destroy the vehicles
Meteors are pilled on top of the base into a 3x3 cube

**********************************
Limitations
**********************************
There's an edge case within the game that will cause a crash but 
its so rare that I'm not sure if its fixed or still there 
(I've only seen it occur after 30min+)

I have the makefile set to the newer MAC OS OpenGL, this may need 
be changed to run on other systems
