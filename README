Overview
**********************************
Player will be put against an AI opponent, tucks can be created by 
pressing t, towers can be put down by pushing y and then selecting 
a location and pushing y again. The game is over at 27 where everything 
will pause. 

**********************************
AI strategy
**********************************
It will place more trucks at the start and then aggressively place 
towers towards the players base. As time goes on the AI will place 
less and less in an attempt to save up points. 

**********************************
Limitations
**********************************
There's an edge case within the game that will cause a crash but 
its so rare that I'm not sure if its fixed or still there 
(I've only seen it occur after 30min+)

I have the makefile set to the newer MAC OS OpenGL, this may need 
be changed to run on other systems
